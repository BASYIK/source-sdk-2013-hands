# SDK-2013-Multiplayer-AI-Fixes

Updated version of the AI Fixes for the Multiplayer Branch of the Source SDK. I'm only doing this since most repos I've found on Github are either filled with useless shit or it's just outdated. I'm also going to be updating this since there are a couple of bugs in the code and I'm too lazy to fix the shit now.
